If you wanted to add Podtrac support to your site, in conjunction with Seriously Simple Podcasting, this is the plugin that will do it.

== Description ==

If you wanted to add Podtrac support to your site, in conjunction with [Seriously Simple Podcasting](http://seriouslysimplepodcasting.com), this is the plugin that will do it. This allows both episode redirects, and feed redirects.

== Installation ==

Installation is simple, either install automatically from the WordPress plugins repository from admin interface of your website, or, upload via FTP.

1. Upload the `/podtrac/` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Update the settings in the Seriously Simple Podcast settings page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is there a per feed redirect setting available? =

This is coming soon, and I hope to be working with Seriously Simple Podcasting team to change how they have it implemented on their end to get this updated.
